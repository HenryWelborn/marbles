# Marbles Blockchain Sample

>Hyperledger Fabric sample Marbles on IBM Blockchain Platform for Multicloud

This code pattern demonstrates setting up a network on the IBM Blockchain Platform and deploying the Marbles smart contract on the network.  Next, we setup our application to interact with the network including identities to submit transactions on the smart contract.  The application is setup with a Node.js server using the Fabric Node SDK to process requests to the network, along with a web interface.

 When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Setup a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform
* Install and instantiate smart contract through the IBM Blockchain Platform
* Develop a Node.js server with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network


## About Marbles
- The underlying network for this application is the [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/docs), a Linux Foundation project.  You may want to review these instructions to understand a bit about the Hyperledger Fabric.
- **This demo is to aid a developer learn the basics of chaincode and app development with a Fabric network.**
- This is a `very simple` asset transfer demonstration. Multiple users can create and transfer marbles with each other.

# Architecture flow

![](./doc_images/comm_flow.png)

1. The admin will interact with Marbles, our Node.js application, in their browser.
2. This client side JS code will open a websocket to the backend Node.js application. The client JS will send messages to the backend when the admin interacts with the site.
3. Reading or writing the ledger is known as a proposal. This proposal is built by Marbles (via the SDK) and then sent to a blockchain peer.
4. The peer will communicate to its Marbles chaincode container. The chaincode will run/simulate the transaction. If there are no issues it will endorse the transaction and send it back to our Marbles application.
5. Marbles (via the SDK) will then send the endorsed proposal to the ordering service.  The orderer will package many proposals from the whole network into a block.  Then it will broadcast the new block to peers in the network.
6. Finally the peer will validate the block and write it to its ledger. The transaction has now taken effect and any subsequent reads will reflect this change.

## Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

### Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Install IBM Blockchain Platform for Multicloud](#3-install-ibm-blockchain-platform-for-multicloud)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy the smart contract on the network](#5-deploy-the-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


## 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```bash
git clone --branch v5.0 https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles.git
cd marbles
```

Setup your Golang environment:

```bash
mkdir ~/go
export GOPATH=~/go
cd ~/go
go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim
mkdir ~/go/src/marbles
cp -r <directory>/marbles/chaincode/src/marbles/ ./src/marbles/
```

## 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension to package the smart contract.

* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from this repository that was cloned earlier.

> Marbles is a [Golang](https://golang.org) smart contract. To properly package the smart contract you must have the environment variable `GOPATH` set. For example:
> ```
> GOPATH=~/go code ~/go/src/marbles
> ```


* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package a Smart Contract Project`.

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

* Next, right click on the packaged contract to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save `.cds` file.  We will use this packages smart contract later to deploy on our work.

</p>

Now, we will start creating our Hyperledger Fabric network.

## 3. Install IBM Blockchain Platform for Multicloud

* Once you have obtaned the IBM Blockchain Platform for Multicloud software, you need to load the archive into IBM Cloud Private.  You will need access to the IBM Private Cloud command line interface tools for this step.

1. Login to the ICP server and the Private Docker Registry
	
```bash
/usr/local/bin/cloudctl login -u $ICP_USER -p $ICP_PASS
docker login -u $ICP_USER -p $ICP_PASS mycluster.icp:8500Â 
```

2. Load the archive

`cloudctl catalog load-ppa-archive --archive ~/ibm-blockchain-platform-prod-2.0.0.tar.gz`

3. (Optional) Create Persistent Volumes

In this demonstration we will use Kubernetes [Local Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local)



<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-kubernetes-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/) service on the IBM Cloud.  You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/create-ibm-blockchain-2-service.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster.  The service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/doc-gifs/deployblockchainservice.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start operating on your blockchain network.

* #### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into [server folder](web-app/server)
  - Update the [config.json](web-app/server/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `org1msp`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "org1msp" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The username you would like to register.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBP.

> the current default setup is to connect to a local fabric instance from VS Code

```js
{
    "connection_file": "mychannel_fabcar_profile.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "org1msp",
    "caName": "169.46.208.151:30404",
    "userName": "user1",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }
}
```


## 7. Run the application

* #### Enroll admin
  - First, navigate to the `web-app` directory, and install the node dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/server
    npm install
    ```

  - Run the `enrollAdmin.js` script
    ```bash
    node enrollAdmin.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    msg: Successfully enrolled admin user app-admin and imported it into the wallet
    ```

* #### Register User
  - Run the `registerUser.js` script.
    ```bash
    node registerUser.js
    ```

  - You should see the following in the terminal:
    ```bash
    Successfully registered and enrolled admin user user1 and imported it into the wallet
    ```



* #### Start the application server
  - From the `server` directory, start the server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

* #### Start the web client
  - In a new terminal, open the web client folder and install the dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd web-app/client
    npm install
    ```

  - Start the client:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You can find the app running at http://localhost:4200/

</p>
<br>


## Troubleshooting
* If you encounter an error ``discover error: access denied``, you need to set the `gatewayDiscovery` properly in your `config.json` file. This is <b>REQUIRED</b>  You must set it as follows to connect to IBP:

                 `"gatewayDiscovery": {"enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false }`
